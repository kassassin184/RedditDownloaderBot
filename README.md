## Setup

### Build

To start, please at first install [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) in your path. On Ubuntu, `apt install ffmpeg` is
enough.

git clone https://github.com/HirbodBehnam/RedditDownloaderBot
cd RedditDownloaderBot
go build ./cmd/RedditDownloaderBot/
```

### Reddit Token

To use this bot, you need to have a registered Reddit application. To do so, you can
use [this](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2#getting-started) guide by Reddit itself.
Choose `Script app` as application type. Doing so, will give you two tokens: A client id and a client secret. (The
client id is the `one personal use script` text on top left)

If you want, you can run this bot using docker compose. To do so, edit `docker-compose.yml` and change the environment
variables needed for bot. Then use `docker compose up` to run the bot.

#### Optional Settings

##### Allowed Users

You can configure the bot to allow only a certain users to access it. This is useful for deploying private bots.
To do so, you need the user ids of the accounts which you want to whitelist. You can get the user id
from [@myidbot](https://t.me/myidbot).
After create an environment variable called `ALLOWED_USERS` and set its value to comma seperated user ids. For example:

```

```
